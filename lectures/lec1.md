# 📌Lecture 1 - DevSecOps Foundations & Secure SDLC


## 📍 Slide 1 – 🌍 What is DevSecOps?

* 🌐 **DevOps** = *Development + Operations* → a culture and practice that brings together software developers and IT operations to deliver applications faster.
* 🔐 **DevSecOps** = *Development + Security + Operations* → extending DevOps by adding **security as a core practice** at every stage of software delivery.
* 🧑‍🤝‍🧑 **Key principle**: *“Security is everyone’s responsibility”* — not just for a separate security team.
* ⚡ **Why it matters**: modern systems are complex and fast-changing; security can no longer be a late “add-on”.
* 🎯 **Ultimate goal**: deliver software that is both **fast** and **secure**, continuously and reliably.
* 📖 **First mentioned**: around **2012–2015** in industry discussions, popularized by organizations like **Gartner and NIST**.

## 📍 Slide 2 – 🔄 Why Security in DevOps Matters

* ⚠️ **Traditional DevOps problem**: speed of delivery often came at the cost of **weak security**.
* 💥 **Real-world incidents**:

  * 🏢 **Equifax breach (2017)** → missed patch → exposed **147M records**.
  * ☁️ **Capital One breach (2019)** → misconfigured AWS firewall → attacker accessed **100M credit card applications**.
  * 🛰️ **SolarWinds attack (2020)** → supply chain compromise → impacted **US government agencies**.
* 💰 **Financial cost**: IBM’s 2023 report showed an average **\$4.45M per data breach** worldwide.
* 🕒 **Time cost**: average breach discovery time = **277 days** (IBM 2023).
* 🔑 **Conclusion**: speed without security = **higher risks, higher costs**.

## 📍 Slide 3 – 🧑‍🤝‍🧑 DevOps Culture & Security Culture

* 🤝 **DevOps culture**: developers and operations teams collaborate, share responsibility, and aim for continuous delivery.
* 🛡️ **Security culture**: security practices are integrated, and **every role cares about security outcomes**.
* 📌 **Shared responsibility**: no “throwing security over the wall” — dev, ops, and sec **work together**.
* 🔄 **Continuous feedback loops**: rapid detection and fixing of vulnerabilities.
* 🛠️ **Automation tools**: CI/CD (Continuous Integration/Continuous Delivery), automated tests, security scans, real-time monitoring.
* 📖 **Cultural models**: inspired by **“The Phoenix Project” (2013)** and **“The DevOps Handbook” (2016)** — now extended with DevSecOps.

## 📍 Slide 4 – 🕰️ The “Shift-Left” Philosophy

* 📖 **Shift-Left** = moving quality and security checks **earlier (“left”) in the SDLC** timeline.
* ⏳ **Traditional model**: security testing only at the end → too late, very expensive to fix issues.
* ✅ **Shift-Left model**: detect problems **during requirements, design, and coding**.
* 💰 **Cost efficiency**: fixing a bug in production can cost **30x more** than fixing it in design (NIST study).
* 📊 **Adoption**: widespread since 2015, now standard in Agile and DevOps pipelines.
* 🧩 **Examples**: threat modeling during design, secure coding guidelines in development, automated SAST (Static Application Security Testing) in CI pipelines.

## 📍 Slide 5 – 📊 Industry Reports & Trends

* 📖 **Verizon DBIR (Data Breach Investigations Report) 2024**:

  * ⚠️ 74% of breaches involve **human mistakes** (misconfigurations, stolen credentials).
  * 🔥 Ransomware remains one of the **top three attack methods**.
* 📖 **OWASP (Open Worldwide Application Security Project) DevSecOps Survey 2023**:

  * 📈 68% of organizations already use **DevSecOps practices**.
  * 🚧 Barriers: lack of **security skills** and **cultural resistance**.
* 🤖 **Emerging trend**: security automation and **AI-based security tools** (e.g., AI-powered code review, vulnerability detection).
* 📅 **Prediction**: by 2026, 50% of new enterprise applications will use **AI-assisted security scanning** (Gartner).

## 📍 Slide 6 – 🏗️ What is the Secure Software Development Life Cycle (Secure SDLC)?

* 📖 **SDLC = Software Development Life Cycle** → the process of building software from planning to maintenance.
* 🔐 **Secure SDLC** = integrate **security checks and practices** into every stage of SDLC.
* 🎯 **Goal**: build software that is **secure by design**, not “patched after release”.
* 🧩 **Phases with security**:

  * 📋 Requirements → add **security requirements**.
  * 🖌️ Design → apply **threat modeling**.
  * 💻 Implementation → follow **secure coding standards**.
  * 🧪 Testing → run **security testing tools**.
  * 🚀 Deployment → use **secure configurations**.
  * 🔄 Maintenance → perform **patch management and monitoring**.

## 📍 Slide 9 – ⚖️ Traditional SDLC vs Secure SDLC

* 🏗️ **Traditional SDLC**:

  * 📋 Requirements → functionality only, no security.
  * 🖌️ Design → focus on features, not threats.
  * 🧪 Testing → security often checked only at the end.
  * ❌ Security = *afterthought*, reactive.
* 🛡️ **Secure SDLC**:

  * 📋 Requirements → include security requirements.
  * 🖌️ Design → apply threat modeling.
  * 💻 Implementation → enforce secure coding standards.
  * 🧪 Testing → integrate security testing into CI/CD pipeline.
  * ✅ Security = *built-in*, proactive.

## 📍 Slide 15 – 🌐 What Are Vulnerabilities?

* 🌐 **Definition**: A **vulnerability** is a weakness in software, system, or process that can be exploited by an attacker.
* 📜 **CVE (Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures)** → a public database of known vulnerabilities [cve.mitre.org](https://cve.mitre.org/).
* 🧩 **CWE (Common Weakness Enumeration)** → a catalog of common software weaknesses [cwe.mitre.org](https://cwe.mitre.org/).
* 🔎 **Exploit** = a method or code used to take advantage of a vulnerability.
* 📈 **Trend**: >25,000 new CVEs published in **2023** (all-time high).
* 🛡️ Goal in DevSecOps: detect vulnerabilities **early** and prevent them from reaching production.

- Affected Apache Log4j library
- Exploited via crafted log messages
- Impacted millions of apps globally in Dec 2021
```

---

## 📍 Slide 16 – 💉 SQL Injection (SQLi)

* 💉 **SQL Injection** = attacker injects malicious **SQL (Structured Query Language)** commands into application queries.
* 📅 **Discovered in late 1990s**, still in **OWASP Top 10** today.
* 🔑 **Why it happens**: application fails to properly validate or sanitize user input.
* ⚡ **Impact**: data theft, data modification, remote code execution in extreme cases.
* 📌 **Famous case**: 2017 Equifax breach → SQLi vulnerability in Apache Struts led to **147M records leaked**.
* 🔗 Reference: [OWASP SQL Injection](https://owasp.org/www-community/attacks/SQL_Injection).

    App --> DB[(💾 Database)]
    Attacker[😈 Attacker Input] --> App
    App --> DB
    DB --> Leak[🔥 Data Exposed]
```

---

### 💻 Example: Vulnerable Code (PHP)

```php
<?php
// ❌ Vulnerable: directly inserting user input into query
$username = $_GET['user']; 
$password = $_GET['pass']; 
$query = "SELECT * FROM users WHERE user = '$username' AND pass = '$password'"; 
$result = mysqli_query($conn, $query);

// An attacker could input: 
// user=admin&pass=' OR '1'='1
// Query becomes:
// SELECT * FROM users WHERE user = 'admin' AND pass = '' OR '1'='1';
// This always returns TRUE → attacker logs in without password
?>
```

---

### 💻 Example: Secure Fix (Prepared Statement)

```php
<?php
// ✅ Secure: using parameterized queries (prepared statements)
$stmt = $conn->prepare("SELECT * FROM users WHERE user=? AND pass=?");
$stmt->bind_param("ss", $username, $password); 
$stmt->execute(); 
$result = $stmt->get_result();

// Now even if attacker tries ' OR '1'='1, it is treated as a string, not SQL
?>
```

---

## 📍 Slide 17 – 📜 Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)

* 📜 **XSS = Cross-Site Scripting** → attacker injects malicious scripts into websites viewed by other users.
* 🧩 Types of XSS:

  * 🔁 **Reflected XSS** → script comes from the request (URL parameter).
  * 💾 **Stored XSS** → script saved in database (e.g., forum comment).
  * 🖥️ **DOM-based XSS** → executed in the browser via JavaScript DOM manipulation.
* ⚡ **Impact**: session hijacking, cookie theft, defacement, malware injection.
* 📅 **First widely documented**: early 2000s; still among most common web vulns.
* 🔗 Reference: [OWASP XSS](https://owasp.org/www-community/attacks/xss/).

```mermaid

---

### 💻 Example: Vulnerable Code (JavaScript)

```html
<!-- ❌ Vulnerable: directly reflecting user input -->
<form action="/search">
  <input type="text" name="q">
</form>
<script>
  // takes query parameter from URL and shows it
  document.write("You searched for: " + location.search.substring(3));
</script>

<!-- Attacker enters: <script>alert('XSS')</script>
Browser executes malicious script → popup, or worse (cookie theft) -->
```

---

### 💻 Example: Secure Fix

```html
<!-- ✅ Secure: properly escape and sanitize input -->
<script>
  function escapeHTML(str) {
    return str.replace(/</g, "&lt;").replace(/>/g, "&gt;");
  }
  const query = escapeHTML(location.search.substring(3));
  document.write("You searched for: " + query);
</script>

<!-- Now <script> is displayed as text, not executed -->
```

---

## 📍 Slide 18 – 🔑 Authentication & Session Vulnerabilities

* 🔑 **Authentication** = verifying identity of a user (e.g., username + password).
* 🧾 **Common problems**:

  * 📋 Weak passwords (e.g., “123456”, “password”).
  * 🔁 Credential reuse (same password across sites).
  * 🕒 Missing MFA (Multi-Factor Authentication).
* 📡 **Session vulnerabilities**:

  * 🏷️ **Session fixation** → attacker sets victim’s session ID.
  * 📦 **Session hijacking** → attacker steals session cookie.
  * 🧩 Poor JWT (JSON Web Token) handling → weak signing or no expiration.
* 🔗 Reference: [OWASP Authentication Cheat Sheet](https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/Authentication_Cheat_Sheet.html).

```

---

### 💻 Example: Weak Authentication (PHP)

```php
<?php
// ❌ Vulnerable: passwords stored in plain text
$query = "SELECT * FROM users WHERE username='$user' AND password='$pass'";
// If database is leaked, all passwords are visible
?>
```

### 💻 Example: Secure Authentication

```php
<?php
// ✅ Secure: use password hashing and verification
$hash = password_hash($pass, PASSWORD_BCRYPT); 
if (password_verify($pass, $stored_hash)) {
   echo "Login success";
}
?>
```

---

## 📍 Slide 19 – 🛑 Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)

* 🛑 **CSRF = Cross-Site Request Forgery** → attacker tricks a user into performing an action they didn’t intend.
* ⚡ Example: clicking a malicious link while logged into your bank account → transfers money.
* 🔑 Root cause: missing verification of **who initiated the request**.
* 📌 Common targets: online banking, account settings, password resets.
* 🔗 Reference: [OWASP CSRF](https://owasp.org/www-community/attacks/csrf).

```mermaid

    participant U as 👤 User
    participant A as 😈 Attacker
    participant B as 🏦 Bank
    U->>B: Legitimate login
    A->>U: Malicious link/email
    U->>B: Unintended request (e.g. transfer $1000)
    B->>A: 💰 Money transferred
```

---

### 💻 Example: Vulnerable Request

```html
<!-- ❌ Vulnerable: bank transfer with no CSRF protection -->
<form action="/transfer" method="POST">
  <input type="hidden" name="amount" value="1000">
  <input type="hidden" name="to" value="attacker123">
</form>

<!-- Attacker tricks user into visiting this page while logged in -->
```

### 💻 Example: Secure Fix with CSRF Token

```html
<!-- ✅ Secure: CSRF token must match server value -->
<form action="/transfer" method="POST">
  <input type="hidden" name="csrf_token" value="random123abc">
  <input type="hidden" name="amount" value="1000">
  <input type="hidden" name="to" value="attacker123">
</form>
```

---

## 📍 Slide 20 – 🗄️ Insecure Deserialization & Logic Bugs

* 🗄️ **Insecure Deserialization** → when applications deserialize untrusted data (e.g., JSON, XML, binary objects).
* ⚡ Attacker modifies serialized data → executes malicious code.
* 🧩 Example: Java object deserialization → remote code execution.
* 🐞 **Logic bugs**: application functions incorrectly due to missing checks (e.g., apply discount twice, bypass limits).
* 🔗 Reference: [OWASP Insecure Deserialization](https://owasp.org/www-community/vulnerabilities/Deserialization_of_untrusted_data).

```mermaid

---

### 💻 Example: Vulnerable (PHP unserialize)

```php
<?php
// ❌ Vulnerable: unserialize() on untrusted input
$data = $_GET['data'];
$obj = unserialize($data);
$obj->run(); // attacker controls object
?>
```

### 💻 Example: Secure Fix

```php
<?php
// ✅ Secure: avoid unserialize on untrusted input
// Use JSON instead of PHP serialize
$data = json_decode($_GET['data'], true);
?>
```

## 📍 Slide 21 – ☁️ Misconfigurations (Cloud, Servers, Containers)

* ☁️ **Cloud misconfigurations**:

  * 📦 Publicly exposed S3 buckets (Amazon cloud storage).
  * 🔑 Hardcoded cloud API keys in repositories.
* 🌐 **Web server misconfigurations**:

  * 🛠️ Directory listing enabled.
  * ⚠️ Default credentials left unchanged.
* 📦 **Container misconfigurations**:

  * 🚪 Running containers as root.
  * ❌ Missing network policies.
* 📊 Fact: Misconfigurations caused **45% of cloud security incidents in 2023** (IBM X-Force Threat Intelligence Report).
* 🔗 Reference: [OWASP Security Misconfiguration](https://owasp.org/www-community/attacks/Configuration).

## 📍 Slide 25 – 🧪 Security by Design

* 🧪 **Security by Design** = building applications with **security principles embedded** from the very beginning.
* 📜 Core principles:

  * 🛡️ **Least Privilege** → users/apps only get minimum access needed.
  * 🏰 **Defense in Depth** → multiple layers of protection.
  * 🚨 **Fail Securely** → system should fail in a safe way (e.g., deny access, not allow).
  * 🔐 **Secure Defaults** → “secure out-of-the-box” (no default passwords, no open ports).
* 📊 Example: browsers implement **sandboxing** → even if one tab is compromised, it cannot break into the whole system.
* 🔗 Reference: [NIST Secure Design Principles](https://csrc.nist.gov/publications/detail/sp/800-160/vol-1/final).

## 📍 Slide 28 – 💻 What is Secure Coding?

* 💻 **Secure Coding** = writing software in a way that prevents security issues and vulnerabilities.
* 📖 Defined in **CERT Secure Coding Standards** (Carnegie Mellon University).
* 🧩 Key principles:

  * 🔍 Validate all inputs.
  * 🧹 Avoid hardcoded secrets.
  * 🔐 Use encryption where needed.
  * 🧯 Handle errors properly (don’t leak sensitive info).
* 📊 Importance: most vulnerabilities in OWASP Top 10 map directly to **bad coding practices**.
* 🔗 Reference: [CERT Secure Coding](https://wiki.sei.cmu.edu/confluence/display/seccode/SEI+CERT+Coding+Standards).

---

### 💻 Example: Insecure vs Secure Code

```python
# ❌ Insecure: concatenating user input into SQL query
query = "SELECT * FROM users WHERE id=" + user_input  

# ✅ Secure: parameterized query (avoids SQL injection)
cursor.execute("SELECT * FROM users WHERE id=%s", (user_input,))
```

---

## 📍 Slide 29 – 📐 Secure Coding Guidelines

* 📐 **General Guidelines**:

  * 🔍 Input validation → whitelist instead of blacklist.
  * 🔒 Use secure libraries and frameworks.
  * 🛑 Don’t reinvent crypto → use tested libraries.
  * 📦 Keep dependencies updated.
  * 🚨 Log security events safely (no secrets in logs).
* 🏢 Standards:

  * 📜 **CERT Guidelines**.
  * 📖 **SEI Secure Coding Practices (2010, updated 2021)**.
  * 📚 **ISO/IEC 27034**.
* 🔗 Reference: [SEI Secure Coding Practices](https://resources.sei.cmu.edu/library/asset-view.cfm?assetid=9697).

---

### 💻 Example: Unsafe vs Safe File Handling (Python)

```python
# ❌ Insecure: opening file from user input path
filename = input("Enter file name: ")
open(filename).read()  # attacker can use "../../../../etc/passwd"

# ✅ Secure: restrict allowed paths
import os
allowed_dir = "/app/data/"
filename = os.path.basename(input("Enter file name: "))
open(os.path.join(allowed_dir, filename)).read()
```

---

## 📍 Slide 30 – 🧑‍💻 Common Coding Mistakes

* 🧑‍💻 Frequent mistakes leading to vulnerabilities:

  * 🔑 Hardcoded secrets (API keys, DB passwords).
  * 💉 Concatenating user input into queries (SQLi, LDAPi).
  * 📤 Exposing stack traces to users.
  * 🗑️ Ignoring error handling.
  * 🧭 Insecure random number generation.
* 📊 Example statistic: 40% of cloud breaches in 2023 linked to **poor code security**.
* 🔗 Reference: [CWE Top 25 Most Dangerous Software Weaknesses](https://cwe.mitre.org/top25/).

---

### 💻 Example: Hardcoded Secret (Insecure)

```python
# ❌ Insecure: hardcoded secret
API_KEY = "mysecretapikey123"  # anyone with source code gets this
```

### 💻 Secure Fix

```python
# ✅ Secure: load secret from environment variable
import os
API_KEY = os.getenv("API_KEY")
```

---

## 📍 Slide 31 – 📊 Languages & Secure Coding

* 📊 Different languages have **different risks**:

  * ☕ **Java** → common issues: serialization attacks, unsafe reflection.
  * 🐍 **Python** → risks: insecure eval(), unsafe deserialization (pickle).
  * 🌐 **JavaScript** → XSS, prototype pollution.
  * 🦀 **Rust/Go** → safer by design (memory safety), but misconfigurations possible.
* 📌 Tip: always check **language-specific secure coding guides**.
* 🔗 References:

  * [Java Secure Coding Guidelines](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase/seccodeguide.html)
  * [Python Security Guide](https://bandit.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)
  * [Node.js Security Best Practices](https://nodejs.org/en/security).

---

### 💻 Example: Insecure eval() in Python

```python
# ❌ Insecure: executing user input
user_input = "__import__('os').system('rm -rf /')"
eval(user_input)  # catastrophic

# ✅ Secure: avoid eval, validate input
import ast
safe_input = ast.literal_eval("123")  # safe evaluation
```

---

## 📍 Slide 32 – 🔍 Code Review & Pair Programming

* 🔍 **Code Review** = systematic examination of code by peers before merging.
* 👥 **Pair Programming** = two developers work together, one writes code, the other reviews in real time.
* 📊 Benefits:

  * 🛑 Catch security issues early (e.g., missing input validation).
  * 📚 Knowledge sharing → junior devs learn secure practices.
  * 🚀 Higher code quality & fewer vulnerabilities.
* 🛡️ Security-specific checklists:

  * 🔑 No hardcoded secrets.
  * 🔒 Proper authentication & access control.
  * 🧩 Input validation and sanitization.
* 🔗 Reference: [OWASP Code Review Guide](https://owasp.org/www-project-code-review/).

### 💻 Example: Code Review Checklist Item

```python
# ❌ Found in review: missing input validation
age = int(input("Enter age: "))  # crash or injection possible

# ✅ Fix: validation before using input
age_str = input("Enter age: ")
if age_str.isdigit():
    age = int(age_str)
else:
    raise ValueError("Invalid input")
```
