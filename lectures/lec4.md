# 📌Lecture 4 - CI/CD Security & Build Hardening

## 📂 Group 1: CI/CD Pipeline Foundations & Architecture

## 📍 Slide 1 – 🏗️ What is CI/CD? (Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment)

* 🏗️ **CI = Continuous Integration** → developers merge code changes frequently (multiple times daily) into a shared repository, triggering **automated builds and tests**.
* 🚀 **CD = Continuous Deployment/Delivery** → automated deployment of validated code changes to **staging/production environments**.
* 🔄 **Core principle**: "**integrate early, deploy often**" → catch issues fast, reduce integration hell, enable rapid releases.
* 🎯 **Benefits**: faster feedback loops, reduced manual errors, consistent deployments, improved team collaboration.
* 📊 **Industry adoption**: **85% of organizations** use CI/CD practices as of 2024 (GitLab DevOps Report).

## 📍 Slide 9 – 🎭 Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) for Pipeline Resources

* 🎭 **RBAC = Role-Based Access Control** → users assigned to **roles**, roles granted **permissions**
* 🏗️ **CI/CD-specific roles** (example hierarchy):
  * 👑 **Pipeline Admin**: full pipeline management, user administration
  * 🔧 **Pipeline Developer**: create/modify pipelines, trigger builds
  * 👀 **Pipeline Viewer**: read-only access to pipeline status and logs
  * 🚀 **Deployer**: deployment permissions to specific environments
  * 📊 **Auditor**: read-only access for compliance and security reviews
* 🎯 **Granular permissions**:
  * 📂 **Repository access**: read/write to specific repos
  * 🔧 **Pipeline operations**: create, modify, delete, execute
  * 🌍 **Environment access**: dev, staging, production deployment
  * 🔑 **Secret access**: view/use specific credentials and tokens
* 📈 **Benefits**: scalable permission management, audit trails, compliance alignment

## 📍 Slide 10 – 🔑 Service Account Security & Credential Management

* 🤖 **Service accounts** = non-human identities for **automated processes** (build agents, deployment scripts, integrations)
* 🔐 **Types of service credentials**:
  * 🎫 **API tokens**: GitHub Personal Access Tokens, GitLab tokens
  * 🎟️ **Service principals**: Azure service principals, AWS IAM roles
  * 🔑 **SSH keys**: for Git operations and server access
  * 🎪 **Workload identity**: cloud-native identity (AWS IRSA, Azure pod identity)
* ⚠️ **Common security risks**:
  * 📝 **Hardcoded secrets**: tokens stored in plain text in pipelines
  * ⏰ **Long-lived credentials**: tokens that never expire
  * 🎯 **Over-privileged access**: service accounts with excessive permissions
  * 🔄 **Credential sharing**: same token used across multiple pipelines
* ✅ **Security best practices**:
  * 🔐 Use **credential managers** (HashiCorp Vault, cloud key vaults)
  * ⏱️ Implement **short-lived tokens** with automatic rotation
  * 🎯 Follow **least privilege principle** for service accounts
  * 🔍 Regular **access reviews** and credential audits

## 📍 Slide 11 – 🛡️ Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for Pipeline Access

* 🛡️ **MFA = Multi-Factor Authentication** → requires **multiple verification factors** beyond password
* 🧩 **Authentication factors**:
  * 🧠 **Something you know**: password, PIN, security questions
  * 📱 **Something you have**: smartphone app, hardware token, SMS
  * 👁️ **Something you are**: fingerprint, face recognition, voice
* 🎯 **CI/CD MFA implementation**:
  * 👤 **Human access**: mandatory MFA for all pipeline administrative access
  * 📱 **TOTP (Time-based OTP)**: Google Authenticator, Microsoft Authenticator
  * 🔑 **Hardware tokens**: YubiKey, FIDO2 security keys
  * 📞 **Push notifications**: mobile app approval workflows
* 📊 **MFA effectiveness**: blocks **99.9% of automated attacks** ([Microsoft Security Intelligence Report](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/business/security-intelligence-report))
* 🏢 **Enterprise requirements**: many organizations mandate MFA for all CI/CD access
* ⚠️ **Bypass risks**: SMS-based MFA vulnerable to SIM swapping, prefer app-based or hardware tokens

## 📍 Slide 12 – ⚖️ Principle of Least Privilege in CI/CD Workflows

* ⚖️ **Least Privilege Principle** → entities should have **minimum permissions** required to perform their function
* 🎯 **Application in CI/CD**:
  * 👤 **Users**: developers only access their team's pipelines
  * 🤖 **Service accounts**: build agents only access required repositories
  * 🔧 **Pipelines**: each pipeline only accesses necessary resources
  * 🌍 **Environments**: staging access ≠ production access
* 📊 **Permission granularity levels**:
  * 🏗️ **Organization level**: admin vs. member access
  * 📂 **Repository level**: read, write, admin permissions
  * 🔧 **Pipeline level**: view, edit, execute, delete
  * 🌍 **Environment level**: deploy, approve, configure
* ⚠️ **Common violations**:
  * 👑 **Admin by default**: giving users more permissions than needed
  * 🔄 **Permission creep**: accumulating permissions over time
  * 🎯 **Broad service accounts**: single account for multiple purposes
* ✅ **Implementation strategies**:
  * 📋 **Regular access reviews**: quarterly permission audits
  * 🔄 **Just-in-time access**: temporary elevated permissions
  * 📊 **Permission analytics**: identify unused or excessive permissions

## 📂 Group 6: Dependency Management & Software Composition Analysis

## 📍 Slide 35 – 📚 Third-Party Dependency Security Risks

* 📚 **Dependencies** = external libraries, frameworks, and components that applications rely on for functionality
* 🎯 **Why dependencies create security risks**:
  * 🦠 **Inherited vulnerabilities**: security flaws in third-party code affect your application
  * 🔗 **Transitive dependencies**: dependencies of dependencies create deep, complex chains
  * 🌍 **Supply chain exposure**: compromised upstream packages can poison entire ecosystems
  * 📊 **Scale complexity**: modern apps contain 100s-1000s of dependencies
* ⚠️ **Common dependency security issues**:
  * 🐛 **Known vulnerabilities**: CVEs in popular libraries (Log4Shell, Struts, etc.)
  * 🦠 **Malicious packages**: intentionally harmful code injected into package repositories
  * 🔄 **Dependency confusion**: attackers exploit naming similarities to inject malicious packages
  * ⏰ **Outdated versions**: using old versions with known security issues
  * 🔑 **License violations**: legal risks from incompatible or restrictive licenses
* 📊 **Scale of the problem**:
  * 📦 **Average application**: contains 500+ open-source components ([Sonatype Report](https://www.sonatype.com/state-of-the-software-supply-chain/))
  * 🐛 **Vulnerability growth**: 20,000+ new vulnerabilities discovered in open-source components annually
  * 🎯 **Attack frequency**: 742% increase in supply chain attacks from 2019-2022
* 🔗 **Real-world impact**: Equifax breach (Apache Struts), SolarWinds attack (build tool compromise)

## 📍 Slide 40 – 🕸️ Dependency Confusion & Typosquatting Prevention

* 🕸️ **Dependency confusion** = attack where malicious packages with **higher version numbers** are published to **public repositories** with same names as **internal packages**
* 🎯 **Typosquatting** = creating malicious packages with **similar names** to popular legitimate packages (e.g., "reqeusts" instead of "requests")
* ⚠️ **Attack mechanisms**:
  * 📦 **Public package priority**: package managers often prefer public repositories over private ones
  * 🔢 **Version precedence**: higher version numbers automatically selected
  * 🔤 **Name similarity**: developers mistype package names in dependencies
  * 🤖 **Automated scanning**: attackers monitor internal package names from public repositories
* 🛡️ **Prevention strategies**:
  * 🏗️ **Package scoping**: use organizational scopes (@company/package-name)
  * 🔐 **Repository prioritization**: configure package managers to prefer private repositories
  * 🚫 **Public repository blocking**: prevent accidental public package installation
  * 📋 **Dependency pinning**: lock specific versions and sources in lockfiles
  * 🔍 **Monitoring & alerting**: detect unauthorized package installations
* 🛠️ **Technical mitigations**:
  * 📦 **npm**: use .npmrc with registry configuration and scoped packages
  * 🐍 **Python**: configure pip.conf with trusted hosts and index priorities
  * ☕ **Maven**: settings.xml with repository mirroring and blocking
  * 🔷 **NuGet**: NuGet.Config with package source mapping
* 📊 **Real-world impact**: **130+ malicious packages** discovered in npm registry targeting dependency confusion in 2023 ([ReversingLabs Research](https://www.reversinglabs.com/blog))
