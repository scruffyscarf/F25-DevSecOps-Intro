> **Goal:** Model OWASP Juice Shop (`bkimminich/juice-shop:v19.0.0`) deployment and generate an automation-first threat model with Threagile.  
> **Deliverable:** A PR from `feature/lab2` to the course repo with `labs/submission2.md` containing Threagile outputs and risk analysis. Submit the PR link via Moodle.

---

## Overview

In this lab you will practice:
- Creating an **as-code** model with **Threagile** and automatically generating **risk reports + diagrams** from YAML
- Making security-relevant model changes and demonstrating how they **impact the risk landscape**
- Analyzing threat model outputs and documenting security findings systematically

> Keep using the Juice Shop from Lab 1 (`:19.0.0`) as your target application.

## Tasks

### Task 1 — Threagile Baseline Model (6 pts)

**Objective:** Use the provided Threagile model to generate a PDF report + diagrams and analyze the baseline risk posture.

#### 1.1: Generate Baseline Threat Model

```bash
mkdir -p labs/lab2/baseline labs/lab2/secure

docker run --rm -v "$(pwd)":/app/work threagile/threagile \
  -model /app/work/labs/lab2/threagile-model.yaml \
  -output /app/work/labs/lab2/baseline \
  -generate-risks-excel=false -generate-tags-excel=false
```

#### 1.2: Verify Generated Outputs

Expected files in `labs/lab2/baseline/`:
- `report.pdf` — full PDF report (includes diagrams)
- Diagrams: data-flow & data-asset diagrams (PNG)
- Risk exports: `risks.json`, `stats.json`, `technical-assets.json`

#### 1.3: Risk Analysis and Documentation

Calculate composite scores using these weights:
- Severity: critical (5) > elevated (4) > high (3) > medium (2) > low (1)
- Likelihood: very-likely (4) > likely (3) > possible (2) > unlikely (1)
- Impact: high (3) > medium (2) > low (1)
- **Composite score** = `Severity*100 + Likelihood*10 + Impact`

In `labs/submission2.md`, document:
- **Top 5 Risks** table with Severity, Category, Asset, Likelihood, Impact
- Risk ranking methodology and composite score calculations
- Analysis of critical security concerns identified
- Screenshots or references to generated diagrams

---

### Task 2 — HTTPS Variant & Risk Comparison (4 pts)

**Objective:** Create a secure variant of the model and demonstrate how security controls affect the threat landscape.

#### 2.1: Create Secure Model Variant

Copy the baseline model and make these specific changes:
- **User Browser → communication_links → Direct to App**: set `protocol: https`
- **Reverse Proxy → communication_links**: set `protocol: https`
- **Persistent Storage**: set `encryption: transparent`
- Save as: `labs/lab2/threagile-model.secure.yaml`

#### 2.2: Generate Secure Variant Analysis

```bash
docker run --rm -v "$(pwd)":/app/work threagile/threagile \
  -model /app/work/labs/lab2/threagile-model.secure.yaml \
  -output /app/work/labs/lab2/secure \
  -generate-risks-excel=false -generate-tags-excel=false
```

#### 2.3: Generate Risk Comparison

```bash
jq -n \
  --slurpfile b labs/lab2/baseline/risks.json \
  --slurpfile s labs/lab2/secure/risks.json '
def tally(x):
(x | group_by(.category) | map({ (.[0].category): length }) | add) // {};
(tally($b[0])) as $B |
(tally($s[0])) as $S |
(($B + $S) | keys | sort) as $cats |
[
"| Category | Baseline | Secure | Δ |",
"|---|---:|---:|---:|"
] + (
$cats | map(
"| " + . + " | " +
(($B[.] // 0) | tostring) + " | " +
(($S[.] // 0) | tostring) + " | " +
(((($S[.] // 0) - ($B[.] // 0))) | tostring) + " |"
)
) | .[]'
```

In `labs/submission2.md`, document:
- **Risk Category Delta Table** (Baseline vs Secure vs Δ)
- **Delta Run Explanation** covering:
  - Specific changes made to the model
  - Observed results in risk categories
  - Analysis of why these changes reduced/modified risks
- Comparison of diagrams between baseline and secure variants

## How to Submit

1. Create a branch for this lab and push it to your fork:

   ```bash
   git switch -c feature/lab2
   # create labs/submission2.md with your findings
   git add labs/submission2.md labs/lab2/
   git commit -m "docs: add lab2 submission"
   git push -u origin feature/lab2
   ```

2. Open a PR from your fork's `feature/lab2` branch → **course repository's main branch**.

3. In the PR description, include:

   ```text
   - [x] Task 1 done — Threagile baseline model + risk analysis
   - [x] Task 2 done — HTTPS variant + risk comparison
   ```

4. **Copy the PR URL** and submit it via **Moodle before the deadline**.

## Guidelines

- Use clear Markdown headers to organize sections in `submission2.md`
- Include both command outputs and written analysis for each task
- Document threat modeling process and security findings systematically
- Ensure all generated artifacts are properly committed to the repository

<details>
<summary>Threat Modeling Notes</summary>

- Model exactly the architecture you're running from Lab 1 (localhost deployment)
- Use consistent asset/link names between baseline and secure models for accurate diffs
- Focus on actionable security insights rather than comprehensive risk catalogs

</details>

<details>
<summary>Technical Tips</summary>

- Verify report PDFs open correctly and diagrams render properly
- Use the provided jq command exactly as shown for consistent delta tables
- Keep explanations concise—one-page summaries are more valuable than detailed reports
- Check that Threagile Docker container has proper file permissions for output generation
